Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | The transaction&#39;s unique ID, issued by Square payments servers. |  [optional]
**locationId** | **String** | The ID of the transaction&#39;s associated location. |  [optional]
**createdAt** | **String** | The time when the transaction was created, in RFC 3339 format. |  [optional]

**referenceId** | **String** | If the transaction was created with the [Charge](#endpoint-charge) endpoint, this value is the same as the value provided for the &#x60;reference_id&#x60; parameter in the request to that endpoint. Otherwise, it is not set. |  [optional]
